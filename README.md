# Coronavirus Spread Prediction

Python script, based on SIR model + astroABC library + Wikipedia data, to predict coronavirus spread.

## Implementation details

Simple, one-dimensional [SIR](https://www.maa.org/press/periodicals/loci/joma/the-sir-model-for-spread-of-disease-the-differential-equation-model) model has been used to simulate the number of people affected. It consists of three dynamic variables, each as a function of time:
 * `S(t)` - percentage of susceptible people (those who can become infected), initially equal `1`
 * `I(t)` - percentage of infected people
 * `R(t)` - percentage of people who are no longer infected (so dead or recovered), initially equal `0`

and two parameters:
 * `b` - transition rate between `S` and `I`
 * `k` - transition rate between `I` and `R`

Cost function which calculates the difference between real data and the data generated by model is max-squared-error. It takes cumulative number of cases as well as temporary number of cases as an input.

To minimize the cost function, the Approximate Bayesian Computation Sequential Monte Carlo (ABC SMC) algorithm implementation ([astroABC](https://github.com/pedrycz/astroABC)) has been introduced with four parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Distribution | Hiperparameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `s%` | percentage of initially susceptible people in whole population | gamma | `k=0.5, scale=0.01` |
| `i%` | percentage of initially infected people | uniform | `from=0, to=0.1` |
| `b` | transition rate between `S` and `I` from SIR model | uniform | `from=0.1, to=1` |
| `k` | transition rate between `I` and `R` from SIR model | uniform | `from=0, to=0.1` |

Other ABC SMC properties:
 * particles: `20`
 * iterations: `10`
 * transitions: from `1e-8` to `1e-13` exponentially

Other values in the script to adjust:
 * `max_offset` - number of real data initial days which can be omitted by cost function (initial data does not usually fit the model)
 * `days_to_verify` - number of real data final days omitted by cost function (in order to verify predictions)
 * `days_to_predict` - number of days predicted

## Install & Run
```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
git clone https://github.com/skytells-research/coronavirus-spread-prediction
cd nCOVID-19-Spread-Prediction
python predict.py
```
## Examples

 * Chinese data till 22.03.2020 predicted using data till 21.02.2020
